# Personal notes

A collection of the snippets, recipes, and little "a-ha" moments that come to mind when learning new technology. 

This is an experiment in seeking alternatives to cloud-based solutions in my workflow--so that I can remain in the tools that I am familiar with while learning, and still retain access to notes across development machines.
